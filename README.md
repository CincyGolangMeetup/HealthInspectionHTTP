# HealthInspectionHTTP
Repository for our teams' playground for HTTP requests to Health Inspection API

This is the first step of a three part workshop where we will work in pairs at our Meetups to build a web application to query for health inspection data on nearby restuarants. 

During each Meetup, we will break into pairs and each pair of programmers will complete the task. 

Each team's code will go in a separate directory in that night's repository. At the end of the Meetup, each team will submit a pull request to the repo. In between Meetups, we will build a canonical version of our work to build on in the next meeting. 

How to Use:
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a directory for your pair.
3. Complete the task by coding within that directory.
4. Make a pull request.
